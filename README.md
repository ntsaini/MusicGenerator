# MusicGenerator
Generate music by playing random set of notes.

A console application written in C# to explore the idea of automatically generating music. Currently a combinatorial approach is implemented with a small subset of input points (7 notes, 3 time intervals).

Next steps involve figuring out heuristics to produce a melody by combining various instruments and rating the output.
